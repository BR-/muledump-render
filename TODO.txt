portrait.js might be auto fixed on its own if I do the above stuff
drop shadow - blur the alpha channel and mask allblack in with it
parse manifest.xml to get tile size instead of guessing by filename
don't rely on haizor to get the data
crop renders.png to get rid of blank space
output full files ready to copy/paste wholesale into muledump
look at Xythium's files
clean up code
Settings Manager > Item Group Sorting needs Mace too, unless it pulls from slotmap
pullreq

autogenerate if possible:
lib/media/itemsilhouettes.png
lib/media/itemsilhouettes_25p.png

stuff that needs manual updating:
slotmap.js
lib/setuptools/src/setuptools.js::defaultSlotOrder
